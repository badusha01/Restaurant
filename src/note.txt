Angular          |      React
---------------------------------

-framework            - library

-real DOM             - virtural DOM

-building blocks      - building blocks
  html,css,ts           html,css,js 

  Advantages of React
  ----------

  -virtural DOM (faster and use less storage space)
  -reusable components
  -concept of jsx(javaScript Xml) 


  installation command
  --------------------

  global installation -
            npm i -g create-react-app projectName
  
  local installation -
             npx create-react-app projectName 

  running command - npm start 


  Data Sharing In React
  ---------------------

  parent component - child component

  In react data can only be shared from parent(App.js) to child. We can add another sub child to the child and transfer data to the sub child.

  In react instead of using variables to store data , state is used.

     Props - Technique used to share data from parent component to child component
     -----

  Hooks
  -----
  ReactJs is function based

  Stateless

  With the help of hooks stateless can change to states(useState)

  useState is in react library


  


useEffect - hook used to call function at starting time of components

Redirection In React
--------------------

react-router-dom - library used for redirection in react 

BrowserRouter - root component selector (wrap the root component in BrowserRouter tag in App.js)
Route - for path setting
Routes - if we use more than one path 


params
------

-useParams - hook used to access params 

REDUX
-----
Props Drilling - data will stuck in any intermediate component when the component have any issues
               - props drilling occurs during coupling(many connections between parent and child)

To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all components independent

so react introduced a state management technology - REDUX 

libraries 
  
  redux 
  react-redux
  redux-thunk

  axios
  -----

  used to call api in react 


  useSelector - hook used to access data from store
